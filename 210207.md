  this course that I gave you for 5 weeks is just introduction.
  It's just test.
  It's just a sample testing like sample food you can try at the costco.
  If you think you like the taste, quality of sample, you can consider buying the product.

  If you think you are interested in the web or programming , you can consider digging deeper.

  Thank you for your time and patience.
